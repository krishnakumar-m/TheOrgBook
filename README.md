# TheOrgBook

A public repository of verifiable claims about organizations. Verifiable claims are issued by trusted public services such as corporate registries, permitting services, licencing services, procurement services and the like.

The Verifiable Organizations Network envisions the possibility of a number of public repositories of Verifiable Claims as a way of bootstrapping a trusted digital ecosystem.
